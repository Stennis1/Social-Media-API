## ALX_SWE_BE Capstone Project: Social Media API

### Project Overview:

As a backend developer, your task is to design and implement a Social Media API using Django and Django REST Framework. This API will allow users to create, update, delete posts, follow other users, and view a feed of posts from the users they follow. You will be responsible for managing user data, posts, and interactions between users in a simulated real-world social media environment. The project will give you experience in user relationships, database interactions, and handling large datasets, all while focusing on CRUD operations and API design.

### Functional Requirements:

#### Post Management (CRUD):
- Implement the ability to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) posts.
- Each post should have the following attributes: Content (text), User (author), Timestamp, and optional Media (e.g., image URLs).
- Ensure validation for required fields like Content and User.
- Users can only update or delete their own posts.

#### Users Management (CRUD):
- Implement CRUD operations for users.
- Each user should have a unique Username, Email, Password, and a profile that includes optional fields like Bio and Profile Picture.
- Only authenticated users should be able to create, update, or delete their own posts.

#### Follow System:
- Create an endpoint to allow users to follow and unfollow other users.
- Implement a system to store the follower and following relationships between users.
- Ensure that users cannot follow themselves.

#### Feed of Posts:
- Create an endpoint to allow users to view a feed of posts from the users they follow.
  - The feed should display posts in reverse chronological order (most recent posts first).
  - Optionally, allow users to filter the feed by date or search for posts by keyword.

### Technical Requirements:

#### Database:
- Use Django ORM to interact with the database.
- Define models for Users, Posts, and Followers.
- Ensure that each post is linked to a user and followers/following relationships are tracked efficiently.

#### Authentication:
- Implement user authentication using Django’s built-in authentication system.
- Users must be logged in to create, update, or delete posts, follow other users, or view their feed.
- Optionally, implement token-based authentication (JWT) to provide secure access to the API.

#### API Design:
- Use Django Rest Framework (DRF) to design and expose the necessary API endpoints.
- Follow RESTful principles, using appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for different operations.
- Ensure proper error handling, with relevant HTTP status codes (e.g., 404 for not found, 400 for bad request).

#### Deployment:
- Deploy the API on Heroku or PythonAnywhere.
- Ensure that the API is accessible, secure, and performs well in the deployed environment.

#### Pagination and Sorting:
- Add pagination to the feed of posts for users with large numbers of followed users or a large volume of posts.
- Provide sorting options such as sorting by Date or Popularity (likes, comments).

### Stretch Goals (Optional):

- **Likes and Comments:** Implement the ability for users to like and comment on posts, with endpoints to manage likes and comments.
- **Notifications:** Add a notification system where users are notified when someone follows them, likes their post, or comments on it.
- **Direct Messaging:** Implement a direct messaging feature allowing users to send private messages to each other.
- **Post Sharing and Reposts:** Add functionality for users to share or “repost” content from other users in their feed.
- **Hashtags and Tagging:** Allow users to tag other users in posts or use hashtags, with endpoints to view posts tagged with specific hashtags or mentions.
- **Trending Posts:** Implement a feature to display trending posts based on the number of likes or reposts in a given period.
- **Profile Customization:** Allow users to customize their profile with additional fields such as Location, Website, and Cover Photo.
- **Media Uploads:** Add functionality for users to upload media files (images, videos) with their posts, storing these files on a cloud service like AWS S3.
